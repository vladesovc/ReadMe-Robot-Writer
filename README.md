## Description
   The motivation behind this project (other than homework) was that I personally needed to get better at ReadMe files and this was a perfect way to streamline and assist in that process to make it easier and painless for me. By making this application I am helping solve a weak point in my finished product repos and this will greatly assist in making them more professional. I learned that coding is a lot of trial and error, and no matter what to keep pushing and trying to ask the right questions.
